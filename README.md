#### Video Demo:  https://youtu.be/SX8oGwS9Lx0?si=_5Kq3TNz5yvOa3xv
#### Description: This Project is a Next JS based personal portfolio website I built for myself, technologies used include JS, JSX and SCSS. The web app has 3 major pages home, about, experience a common footer to all pages is the contact page which can also be viewed as a 4th page. I used many JS algorithms and smart SCSS to achieve refreshing animations throughout the webapp, I also made it mobile compatible through scalling SCSS classes. Each of the pages follows a different theme and animation mechanics. The total project exeeds 3kilo lines of code and has a complete and compelling profile for a portfolio website. Each page is acually constistant of multiple jsx files that are routed togather, this gave me more creative freedom to add more animations without disturbing the previous files active animations, addionally a cascading effect when scrolling through sections was acheiveable too. The src file and the public data file are available, upon saving them and creating a next js environment with scss and installing libraries such as gasp the webapp should become operational, I have excluded these files as they take up too much storage. Thank you!
